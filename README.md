# Challenge - Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

This is my second ever challenge ever done, as a practice for my fundamental knowledge of the languages. I was provided with a style guide for the correct font and colors.

If i'll get some feedback, i would love to know how effective my code is, and if i could have done anything in a more simple way. For example, since the image became a "block" item, i could'nt add margin-bottom to push down the h1. I instead added some margin-top on the h1, even though i wanted to follow the pattern of only adding margin-bottom to give spacing between the elements along the page. Could i have done anything different?

Much love
